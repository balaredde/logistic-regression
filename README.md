# Logistic Regression for Insurance Prediction

This project applies **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a person will buy insurance based on their age.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `insurance_data.csv`, which contains:
- `age`: The age of the person
- `bought_insurance`: (0 or 1) indicating whether insurance was purchased

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the `Untitled5.ipynb` file.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the file.
3. Execute the cells sequentially.

## Steps in the Notebook
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Load and explore the dataset.
3. Visualize the data using scatter plots.
4. Split the data into training and test sets.
5. Train a **Logistic Regression** model using `sklearn`.
6. Make predictions and evaluate the model.

## Results
The model predicts whether a person is likely to purchase insurance based on their age, using logistic regression.
